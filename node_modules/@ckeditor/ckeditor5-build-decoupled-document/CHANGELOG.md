### Other changes

* Image styles's default configuration has been changed to: left-aligned, right-aligned image and full-size image (instead of the typical: side-image and full-size image). This change makes content previously created with this build incompatible with the new setup.

   You can [configure image styles](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/features/image.html#image-styles) in order to bring back the old setting (`[ 'full', 'side' ]`).

   Closes [#10](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/issues/10). ([75855d9](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/commit/75855d9))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The default image styles configuration has been changed (see the section above for more information).
